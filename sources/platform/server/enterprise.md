# Enterprise installations

In addition to the standard two server installation described for [Small to mid-sized teams](/platform/server/install-two-server), we also support Enterprise installations which can be scaled out over many nodes and support tens of thousands of concurrent users. In fact, we use this type of installation ourselves for our Hosted service at https://app.shippable.com.

If you are interested in learning more about a large scale deployment of Shippable Server, please contact us via email at [support@shippable.com](mailto:support@shippable.com) or through our [Server contact form](https://www.shippable.com/enterprise.html#shippable-server-contact).
