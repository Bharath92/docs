# Custom Views

When you have a lot of enabled projects or pipeline jobs, it is difficult to check the status of a particular job or project from home dashboard.
Custom views allows you to add customized dashboards by enabling you to choose projects, pipeline [flags](/validate/single-pane-of-glass-spog/#filter-spog)  and pipeline [jobs](/reference/workflow/job/overview/).
You can also choose to make a custom view your default account dashboard.
