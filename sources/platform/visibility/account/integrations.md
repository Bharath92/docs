# Account Integrations View
This view has the list of all the [Integrations](/platform/integration/overview) the current logged in user has created. You can create new ones, edit or delete existing ones. 

Data that is stored as part of the Integration is encrypted both at rest and in flight. You can also control which organization/project has the permission to use the integration and you can revoke access at any given point of time. 

You can also update the values stored and since all [Jobs](/platform/workflow/job/overview) that use this integration refer to it with pointers, they all get the new values the next time the job executes
