# BYON Nodes

Shippable platform enables you to either use Shippable provided [On demand](/platform/runtime/nodes/#dynamic-nodes/) nodes or [BYON nodes](/platform/runtime/nodes/#custom-nodes). The biggest reason for doing this is that your code never leaves your infrastructure. Because of this, we try to keep adding support for more
architectures, operating systems and Docker versions that can be used with Shippable. Following is the
list of platforms that are currently supported.


|Architecture|OS|Docker Version|
|---|---|---|
|x86_64|CentOS 7|17.06|
|x86_64|macOS 10.12|17.06|
|x86_64|Ubuntu 14.04|1.9|
|x86_64|Ubuntu 14.04|1.11|

|x86_64|Ubuntu 16.04|1.13|
