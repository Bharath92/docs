# Working with Triggers

[Triggers](/platform/workflow/resource/trigger/) are used to manually start a job. They are the only resources that will start dependent jobs when updated in the YML.

Triggers are added in the same way as all other resources.  See [Working with Resources](/platform/tutorial/workflow/crud-resource) for more information.
