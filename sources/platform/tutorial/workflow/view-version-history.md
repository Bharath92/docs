# Viewing version history jobs and resources

Every job and resource of your workflow is versioned. This means that each time your resource changes or your job executes, a new version is created.

You can view version history for a job or history by doing one of the following:

* Clicking on the name of the job in the Grid view.
* Clicking on the name of the job in SPOG view. This will show you the job console for the latest run. To view version history, click on the job name in the breadcrumb.

Version history for a job looks like this:
