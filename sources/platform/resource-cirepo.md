# ciRepo
This resource is simply a representation of a project that is enabled for Shippable CI.  This resource is automatically created when a project is enabled.  If your project is already enabled, you may need to click the "Hook" button on the project settings page.  This resource acts as an input to the [runCI job](jobs-runci/)

This resource cannot be configured via `shippable.resources.yml` at this time.
