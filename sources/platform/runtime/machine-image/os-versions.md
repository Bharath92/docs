# Operating Systems

We support the following Operating systems for your `runCI` jobs:

* Ubuntu 14.04

For your `runSh` jobs, we only support Ubuntu 14.04 as of now since it runs inside the Shippable Agent, as explained in the [Machine image overview](/platform/runtime/machine-image/ami-overview/).
