# Caching

You can optionally turn on caching for your jobs to speed up your build by pulling your cache instead of installing all your dependencies.

## Caching types
Currecntly we support two types of cachings.

* Node caching
* Artifact caching 

## Node caching

### How node caching works

You can enable node caching for any of your on-demand nodepool and then all the nodes created for that particular nodepool will be cached. This type of caching is not limited to only runCI jobs. This can be used for all the jobs running on that node.

If node caching is enabled for any of your nodepool then this means all the nodes coming under that nodepool will not be terminated for the duration you set in tha cache settings. We will just start and stop the nodes when ever required. In this way all your build dependencies will always be present.

### How to enable node caching

You can enable node caching for any of your node caching while editing the nodepool and selecting the cache checkbox. We have some default cache setting when you select the cache checkbox, you can also edit them if required.

You will see this cache checkbox on the nodepool edit page only if SKU for that nodepool has `cache` addon. Click [here](/platform/management/subscription/billing/) to see how you can enable `cache` for any of your plan.

### Clearing cache
You can remove caching from your nodepool anytime by navigating to the edit nodepool page and disabling cache option. Now if your node remains idle for a long time then we will terminate the existing node and when next time you try running a build we will initialize a fresh node for you, hence all your installations from previous builds will be gone.


## Artifact caching

### How artifact caching works

If caching is turned on, your cache is updated for every build and is available to subsequent builds. We create a tarball of whatever needs to be cached and upload it to S3 at the end of the build. Caching occurs at the **project level** only.

Caching per branch is currently unsupported, so your cache will be updated for each build regardless of branch.

The roundtrip to and from S3 means that caching is very useful in specific scenarios and not so much in others:

* Files that take a long time to install benefit from caching. So anything related to bundler, npm, composer, pip, etc are great candidates for caching.

* Files that take a long time to download but installed quickly do not benefit from caching since it takes as much time to download from S3 as from the original source. Examples are compiled binaries, JDK packages, etc.

### Artifact caching with multiple nodes

You may have setup multiple nodes for a Subscription to run multiple builds in parallel. In this scenario, all nodes will get initialized with the same initial state of the cache and the cache will get updated at the end of each build.

### Artifact caching for matrix builds

If you have one node in your plan and run a matrix build with cache turned on, each build in the matrix will update the cache, which will be used by every subsequent build in the matrix.

For matrix builds across multiple nodes, lets assume N nodes and M builds with M > N. The caching for the first N builds will work as mentioned in the previous section. The (N + 1)th build will use the cache created by the last matrix build that completed.

### Clearing cache

You can clear cache in one of two ways:

*  Including ``[reset minion]`` or ``[reset_minion]`` in your commit message.
*  Clicking on **Reset cache** in your Project Settings UI.

In both cases, your cached content will be deleted before the job is run. This is a one-time action, so if cache is still set to true in your yml, the CI job will generate a new cache which will be used for subsequent builds.

This method is the best way to run a job with no cache without changing your `shippable.yml`.

* [Caching ruby gems](/ci/caching/#2-caching-ruby-gems)
