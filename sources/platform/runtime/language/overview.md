# Languages
The Shippable Platform provides images with multiple versions of commonly-used languages pre-installed. A default image will be selected based on the language specified in your [shippable.yml](/platform/tutorial/workflow/shippable-yml/) file when running a CI job, or you can select a different image in the `pre_ci_boot` section of your `shippable.yml`.

Our language specific images that are updated monthly so that the latest and greatest versions are always available for you to test.  See the following pages for more information about which versions are available in each image.
