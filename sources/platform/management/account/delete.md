# Deleting your account

You can delete your account by clicking on **Profile** in your left navbar, and clicking on **Delete** in the **Delete Account** section.

Some things to remember while deleting your project:

* All your projects and job history will be deleted from Shippable.
* Deleting your Shippable subscription does not affect anything in your source control.
* Your organizational projects will not be deleted. This is because multiple people share an organizational subscription, and we cannot determine if it should be deleted.
* **This action is not reversible.**

If you have trouble deleting your account, please [open a support issue](https://github.com/Shippable/support/issues).
