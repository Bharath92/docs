# Account Integrations

[Integrations](/platform/integration/overview/) let you connect your Shippable workflows to third-party services, or to store any sensitive information like passwords, tokens, etc, or simply to store key-value pairs needed for your workflows.

To view a list of currently configured account integrations, click on **Integrations** in your left sidebar menu.

The following documents will help you understand how integrations work, and how to work with them:

* [Integrations overview](/platform/integration/overview/)
