When you sign up, we set to the primary email address of the source control provider account you used to sign in to Shippable as the default email for sending notifications.

If you want to receive notifications at a different address by default, follow these steps:

- [Sign in to Shippable](https://app.shippable.com)
- Click on **Profile** in the left navbar
- In the **Notification email** input, enter the email address you want to receive notifications , and click on **Save**

You will start receiving all subsequent notifications at the address you configured.

**Please note that once you change this, you cannot undo this action.**
