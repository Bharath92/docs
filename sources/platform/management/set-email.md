# Setting account email

When you sign up, we set to the primary email address of the source control provider account you use to sign in to Shippable as the default email for sending notifications.

If you want to send notifications to a different address by default, follow these steps:

- [Sign in to Shippable](https://app.shippable.com)
- Click on the gear icon at the right of your top navigation bar to open **Account Settings**
- In the **Account Information** section, click on **Edit** in the email sub-section.
- Enter your new email address and click on **Save**

You will start receiving all subsequent notifications at the address you configured.

**Please note that once you change this, you cannot undo this action.**
