# NodeJs Job Images

Job Images for NodeJs are available for multiple language / operating system versions. Each language-os combination
is published in Docker hub as an image with a specific tag. The Docker hub account where we publish these images is drydock.

If you specify the language and os in Shippable.yml, the platform automatically selects the right image for you. However,
you can also boot the job runtime with any image.
