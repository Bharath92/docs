#API Tokens
This is where you generate, view and manage access tokens to use our [API](/platform/api/api-overview).

##Adding a token

To add a token:

- Click on **Profile** in your left sidebar menu.
- In the **API Tokens** section, click on the **+** icon at the right of the panel.
- Enter a token name and click on **Create** to create a new token.
- IMPORTANT: Remember to copy the token. For security reasons, the token will never
be displayed again.

##Deleting a token

To delete a token, click on the token you want to delete and click on the **Delete** button.

##Free User vs Paid User Tokens

API tokens generated by users without a paid plan have limited access and can only use the tokens in eventTrigger to trigger a build.

If you have a paid plan, your API tokens have access to the complete Shippable API.  

**Please remember to keep your token safe and do not share it with anyone.** If your token get compromised, API calls can be made on your behalf and compromise the security of your Shippable account.

Treat your API token like an admin password. In case this happens, just deleting the token will remove all access to the token. You can create a new one to replace it and make sure you update it in all external services that might have been using it.
