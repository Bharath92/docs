# Nodes

* [Free Dynamic nodes](https://www.shippable.com/pricing.html)
  Shippable offers a free 2 core, 3.75GB RAM node to run your builds. You can also upgrade to a paid plan
  for more powerful nodes if you need additional memory or faster processors to speed up your builds.

* [Custom Nodes](/getting-started/byon-overview/)
  Custom Noes lets you run builds on your own infrastructure. It enabled you to attach your machines to your Shippable subscription and route all builds to those machines. Your code thus never leaves your network.
