# Webhook Integration

**Webhook** Integration is used to connect Shippable DevOps Assembly Lines platform so that you can send a webhook to an external service with custom payloads

## Adding the account integration

You can add this account integration by following steps on the [Adding an account integration](/platform/management/integrations/#adding-an-account-integration) page.

Here is the information you need to create this integration:

* **Integration Family** -- **Generic**
* **Integration type** -- **Webhook**
* **Name** -- choose a friendly name for the integration
* **WebhookURL** -- endpoint to send payload to
* **Authorization** -- Token based auth to the external URL

## Usage in CI

* [Using Webhook integration in your CI workflow](/ci/webhook/)

## Usage in Assembly Lines

Webhook can be used in the following [resources](/platform/workflow/resource/overview/):

* [integration](/platform/workflow/resource/integration)

### Default Environment Variables
When you create a resource with this integration, and use it as an `IN` or `OUT` for a `runSh` or `runCI` job, a set of environment variables is automatically made available that you can use in your scripts.

`<NAME>` is the the friendly name of the resource with all letters capitalized and all characters that are not letters, numbers or underscores removed. For example, `my-key-1` will be converted to `MYKEY1`, and `my_key_1` will be converted to `MY_KEY_1`.

| Environment variable						| Description                         |
| ------------- 								|------------------------------------ |
| `<NAME>`\_INTEGRATION\_WEBHOOKURL		| Webhook URL, it is available for Generic Webhooks only |
| `<NAME>`\_INTEGRATION\_AUTHORIZATION	| Authorization token that was set in the integration  |

### Shippable Utility Functions
To make it easy to use these environment variables, the platform provides a command line utility that can be used to work with these values.

How to use these utility functions is [documented here](/platform/tutorial/workflow/using-shipctl).
