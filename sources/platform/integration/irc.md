# IRC Integration (Deprecated)

## Deprecation Note
This integration has been deprecated. You can get IRC notifications in [CI](/ci/irc-notifications/) and [assembly lines](/platform/workflow/resource/notification/) by specifying recipients in yml files.

If you have any existing IRC account integrations, you _can_ continue to use them.

---


As of this time, Shippable only supports public IRC rooms, so you do not need an account integration to connect and send notifications to your IRC rooms.

## Usage in CI

* [Sending IRC notifications](/ci/irc-notifications/)

### Usage in Assembly Lines

IRC can be used in the following [resources](/platform/workflow/resource/overview/):

* [notification](/platform/workflow/resource/notification)
