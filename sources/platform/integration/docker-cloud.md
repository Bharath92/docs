# Docker Cloud integration

Available under the Integration Family: **Deploy**

`Docker Cloud` Integration is used to connect Shippable DevOps Assembly Lines platform to Docker Cloud so that you can deploy Docker based apps to Docker Cloud.

You can create this from the integrations page by following instructions here: [Adding an account integration](/platform/management/integrations/#adding-an-account-integration).

This is the information you would require to create this integration:

* **Name** -- friendly name for the integration
* **Username** -- login to your Docker Cloud Account
* **Token** -- API Token to deploy to your Docker Cloud Account

## Resources that use this Integration
Resources are the building blocks of assembly lines and some types of resources refer to integrations by their names. The following resource types can be created with a `Docker Cloud` integration.

* [cluster](/platform/workflow/resource/cluster)
* [integration](/platform/workflow/resource/integration)

## Default Environment Variables
When you create a resource with this integration, and use it as an `IN` or `OUT` for a `runSh` or `runCI` job, a set of environment variables is automatically made available that you can use in your scripts.

`<NAME>` is the the friendly name of the resource with all letters capitalized and all characters that are not letters, numbers or underscores removed. For example, `my-key-1` will be converted to `MYKEY1`, and `my_key_1` will be converted to `MY_KEY_1`.

| Environment variable						| Description                         |
| ------------- 								|------------------------------------ |
| `<NAME>`\_INTEGRATION\_USERNAME   		| Username supplied in the integration |
| `<NAME>`\_INTEGRATION\_TOKEN			| Password supplied in the integration |

## Shippable Utility Functions
To make it easy to use these environment variables, the platform provides a command line utility that can be used to work with these values.

How to use these utility functions is [documented here](/platform/tutorial/workflow/using-shipctl).
