# ciRepo
This resource is simply a representation of a project that is enabled for Shippable CI.  This resource is automatically created when a project is enabled.  This resource acts as an input to the [runCI job](/platform/workflow/job/runci/).

This resource cannot be configured via `shippable.yml` at this time. If your project is already enabled and your subscription does not have a ciRepo resource, you may need to click the "Hook" button on the project settings page.
