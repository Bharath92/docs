# Deploying to Container Orchestration Platforms

Shippable supports continuous deployments to many Container Orchestration Platforms using Docker images on many popular Docker registries.

## Supported Orchestration Platforms

- [Amazon ECS](/platform/integration/amazon-ecs)
- [Kubernetes](/platform/integration/kubernetes)
- [Google Container Engine](/platform/integration/gke)
- [Azure Container Service](/platform/integration/azure-dcos)
- [Azure DC/OS](/platform/integration/azure-dcos)
- [Docker Cloud](/platform/integration/docker-cloud)
- [Docker Datacenter](/platform/integration/docker-datacenter)
- [Joyent Triton](/platform/integration/tripub)

## Supported Docker Registries

- [AWS ECR](/platform/integration/aws-ecr)
- [Docker Hub](/platform/integration/docker-hub)
- [Docker Trusted Registry](/platform/integration/docker-trusted-registry)
- [Docker Private Registry](/platform/integration/docker-private-registry)
- [Google Container Registry](/platform/integration/gcr)
- [Quay](/platform/integration/quay)
- [JFrog](/platform/integration/jfrog-artifactory)

## Usecases

We have put together tutorials for some common usecases.

- [Continuous Delivery of a single container application to an orchestration platform](/deploy/cd_of_single_container_applications_to_orchestration_platforms)
- [Continuous Delivery of a multiple container application to a container orchestration platform](/deploy/cd_of_multi_container_applications_to_orchestration_platforms)

These usecase based tutorials demonstrate powerful platform capabilities that will enable you to build continuous deployment pipelines for your single or multi container applications to any of the supported orchestration platforms.
