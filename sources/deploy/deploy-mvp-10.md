# Pausing/Resuming the continuous deployment of an application deployed to a container orchestration service.
After your application has been setup for continuous deployment to a container orchestration service, you might want to be
pause its deployment sometimes. Thereafter, you might want to resume continuous deployment.

You can use the [SPOG](/platform/visibility/single-pane-of-glass-spog/) UI to pause/run any [deploy](/platform/workflow/job/deploy/) job in your assembly line. Specific instructions can be found [here](/platform/visibility/single-pane-of-glass-spog/#runpause-job).
