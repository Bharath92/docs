page_description: How to get embeddable build status and code coverage badges for your project

# Build badges

You can get embeddable build status and code coverage badges for your project. These provide a visual indication of project status and code coverage percentage.

- Go to your Project in the UI and click on the **Badges** icon in the top right.

- Select the branch you want the status for and also whether you want the **Image URL** or **Markdown** code.

- Copy the code. You can use this code anywhere you want to display the badge.

Here is how the badges look:

<img src="/images/ci/status-badge.png" alt="Status badge"> <img src="/images/ci/coverage-badge.png" alt="Coverage badge">

Many customers display this badge in the README.md of their project so anyone who goes to the project page on GitHub/Bitbucket can see it and know the project's status.  

To learn more about practical examples, check out our blog - [Configuring a build badge for a node.js project status](http://blog.shippable.com/configuring-a-visual-indicator-for-a-node.js-project-status).
