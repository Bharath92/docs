-  [Node.js](nodejs-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Python](python-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Java](java-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Ruby](ruby-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Go](go-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Scala](scala-continuous-integration.md)
-  [PHP](php-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Clojure](clojure-continuous-integration.md)
