# Creating Jira issues

If you are using Jira for issue tracking and project management, you can create Jira issues from within the Shippable UI to report bugs. You can also attach job logs to help with debugging.

For a detailed tutorial on how to create Jira issues, refer to our [Platform tutorial for this scenario](/platform/tutorial/workflow/create-jira-issues).
