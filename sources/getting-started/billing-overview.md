# Shippable Plans and Pricing

Shippable has several tiers of pricing plans which cater to different types of customers. We are a freemium service with a very competitive free tier which is usually enough for individual users as well as small development teams.

As your team grows or you need more capacity, we have several paid options that address your needs. For a detailed look at Pricing plans, please visit our [Pricing page](https://www.shippable.com/pricing.html).
