# Pipeline Basics

At a very fundamental level, pipelines consist of two components: Jobs and Resources.

- [Jobs](/platform/jobs-overview/) are the executable units of your pipelines. They take one or more resources as inputs, perform some operation on the inputs, and can output to other resources. Jobs can also act as inputs for other jobs, which serve to daisy-chain a series of jobs into a pipeline. Examples of jobs include CI, deploy, release, etc.  

- [Resources](/platform/resources-overview/) are versioned objects that hold the configuration and other information required to execute your pipeline. They are inputs for and sometimes outputs from Jobs. Examples of resources include source code repositories, docker images, container clusters, environment variables, etc.

Your pipeline is a bunch of jobs that are triggered in sequence or in parallel, depending on how they are configured. A job can be triggered in multiple ways: when a preceding job finishes, when an input resource is updated by an upstream job, or manually.

##Terminology

A glossary of terms is available in our [Reference](/platform/glossary/).

##Configuration

Your pipelines are defined through four yml-based configuration files:

**CI config**

- `shippable.yml` is used to configure your continuous integration (CI) workflow. This is the only file you need if you want to only use Shippable for CI. It must reside at the root of your repository. [Read more...](/ci/yml-structure/)

**Pipeline config**

- `shippable.jobs.yml` contains definitions of the Jobs in your pipeline. If you only want to use Shippable for CI, you do not need this file. [Read more...](/platform/jobs-overview/)

- `shippable.resources.yml` contains definitions of the Resources in your pipeline. If you only want to use Shippable for CI, you do not need this file. [Read more...](/platform/resources-overview/)

- `shippable.triggers.yml` contains definitions of manual triggers for Jobs in your pipeline. You can manually trigger any job in your pipeline and by pushing a change to this file. This file is optional since you can also run jobs manually through the UI. [Read more...](/platform/shippable-triggers-yml/)

Pipeline configuration files should be committed to a repository in your source control. This repository is called a [sync repository](#sync). If you have separate deployment pipelines for different environments or applications, you can put config files for each environment or application in separate repositories.

You need to specify your [CI config](/ci/yml-structure/) in `shippable.yml` located at the root of your repository. Optionally, you can include this job in your `shippable.jobs.yml` to [connect it to other jobs](/ci/trigger-pipeline-jobs/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Everything in a manifest is always deployed as a whole on to a single node(virtual machine, physical machine etc). Manifests are also scaled as a whole, so creating multiple replicas of a manifest leads to multiple copies of the entire manifest. Depending on your architecture and requirements, your unit of deployment can be a service, microservice, or even the entire application. |

If you want to work with a support CLI, you can provide a cliConfig resource as an input and the relevant CLI tools will automatically be installed and configured. You can also specify any other resources as IN and OUT but you will need to manage the versions and state of the resources with your scripts.                                                                    |

You can specify any resources as IN and OUT but you will need to manage the versions and state of the resources with your scripts.  We recommend you use runCLI for custom scripting since it gives you everything runSh gives you, in addition to being able to specify pre-configured CLIs.                                                                                                 |

| [notification](/platform/resource-notification/)   | Any                                   | The notification resource is used to send out notifications when the job starts, succeeds, and/or fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [params](/platform/resource-params/)               | manifest, deploy, runCLI, runSh       | The params resource provide a convenient way to pass key-value pairs into an environment. When used as an input to manifest or deploy jobs, params resources add a list of environment parameters to an application or microservice. When added as an input to unmanaged jobs, such as runSh or runCLI jobs, the key-value pairs in the params resource are added as environment variables in that job and are available for your scripts. |
