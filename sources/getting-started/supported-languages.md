# Supported languages

Shippable has native support for most popular languages including Node.js, Ruby, Java, Scala, Go, etc. If you are running a build for a project written in a supported language, you should be able to configure your CI pretty easily by following the instructions in the relevant guide below:

-  [Node.js](../ci/nodejs-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Python](../ci/python-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Java](../ci/java-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Ruby](../ci/ruby-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Go](../ci/go-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Scala](../ci/scala-continuous-integration.md)
-  [PHP](../ci/php-continuous-integration.md)
-  [Clojure](../ci/clojure-continuous-integration.md)
-  [C/C++](../ci/cpp-continuous-integration.md)
