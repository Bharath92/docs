However, you can output any resource as desired. | This job represents your CI workflow and is automatically created when you enable a repository for CI. You can include it in your shippable.jobs.yml to connect it to other jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Everything in a manifest is always deployed as a whole on to a single node(virtual machine, physical machine etc). Manifests are also scaled as a whole, so creating multiple replicas of a manifest leads to multiple copies of the entire manifest. Depending on your architecture and requirements, your unit of deployment can be a service, microservice, or even the entire application. |

They can take multiple job type as an IN, but if sequenced after a deploy or release job, there must be a manifest somewhere in the upstream pipeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If you want to work with a support CLI, you can provide a cliConfig resource as an input and the relevant CLI tools will automatically be installed and configured. You can also specify any other resources as IN and OUT but you will need to manage the versions and state of the resources with your scripts.                                                                    |

You can specify any resources as IN and OUT but you will need to manage the versions and state of the resources with your scripts.  We recommend you use runCLI for custom scripting since it gives you everything runSh gives you, in addition to being able to specify pre-configured CLIs.                                                                                                 |

When used as an input to manifest or deploy jobs, params resources add a list of environment parameters to an application or microservice. When added as an input to unmanaged jobs, such as runSh or runCLI jobs, the key-value pairs in the params resource are added as environment variables in that job and are available for your scripts. |
