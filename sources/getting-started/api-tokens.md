#API Tokens

The [REST-based Shippable API](../../reference/api-overview/) is fully documented and you can implement custom workflows by calling the API as needed. You need an API token in order to make calls to our API.

All paid subscriptions have complete access to all available APIs. Free subscriptions can only call a subset of APIs [documented here.](#free-api-token).

**Please remember to keep your token safe and do not share it with anyone.** If your token get compromised, API calls can be made on your behalf and compromise the security of your Shippable account.
Treat your API token like an admin password. If your token does get compromised, deleting the token will remove all access to the token.

##Generating a token

To generate a new API token:

- Go to your Subscription by clicking on the **Subscriptions** dropdown at the top left of your dashboard and selecting the subscription you want to attach the nodes to.

- IMPORTANT: Remember to copy the token. For security reasons, the token will never
be displayed again.

##Free User Tokens

API tokens generated by a user on free plan are called free user tokens. Free user tokens have limited access and can only access the following endpoints:

| Method|Endpoint|
|----------|-------------------------------|
| POST     | /projects/:projectId/newBuild |
| GET      | /resources/:resourceId  |      
| POST     | /versions               |     
| POST     | /v2/versions            |
