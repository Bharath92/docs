# Supported services

Shippable supports many popular services like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc. With a simple one line config in your `shippable.yml`, you can have any supported service up and running and available for your build.

All supported services are pre-installed on your build machines, so you do not have to install them as part of your CI config.
